          <article class="prose prose-invert prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-200 space-y-6">
            <p>Here's the thing about learning languages – it's supposed to be hard work, right? Hours of flashcards, grammar drills, awkward conversations with language exchange partners. But what if I told you there's a way to pick up Spanish or Japanese without ever opening a textbook?</p>
            
            <p>That's exactly what we built Janus for. It's a Chrome extension that quietly swaps out words on websites with their translations. So while you're doing what you normally do online – reading news, scrolling social media, checking work emails – you're also absorbing new vocabulary. No extra time carved out of your day, no guilt about skipping study sessions.</p>

            <h2>Learning While You Live Your Life</h2>
            
            <p>The beauty of Janus is that it hijacks something you're already doing. You're going to read stuff online anyway, so why not make it educational? The extension sprinkles foreign words throughout the pages you visit. You might see <em>gracias</em> instead of "thank you" in an article, or <em>bonjour</em> replacing "hello" in a comment thread.</p>

            <p>The crazy part? You still understand everything. Your brain fills in the gaps using context clues, but those foreign words start sticking around in your memory. It's like having a really patient language teacher who follows you around the internet.</p>

            <p>I've been using it to learn Portuguese, and last week I caught myself understanding a conversation at a Brazilian restaurant without even thinking about it. Those little word swaps had been building up in my head for months.</p>

            <h2>Why This Actually Works Better Than Flashcards</h2>
            
            <p>Remember cramming vocabulary lists in school? You'd memorize 50 words, ace the test, then forget half of them by next week. That's because isolated words are boring to your brain – there's nothing to hook them to.</p>

            <p>When you see a word in context, though, your brain creates a whole story around it. Reading "I need to buy 牛奶 for breakfast" teaches you that 牛奶 means milk, but it also connects it to morning routines, grocery shopping, maybe even the specific article you were reading about healthy habits.</p>

            <p>Context is everything. It's why kids don't learn their first language through flashcards – they pick it up from hearing it used in real situations, over and over again. Janus recreates that natural learning process in your second language.</p>

            <h2>Perfect for People Who Don't Have Time to Study</h2>

            <p>Let's be honest – most of us start learning languages with good intentions, then life gets in the way. Work gets busy, kids need attention, Netflix has a new season of that show you're watching. Traditional language learning demands you show up consistently, and that's where most people fail.</p>

            <p>But you're going to browse the internet anyway. Might as well make it count for something. With Janus, even your procrastination becomes productive. Scrolling through Reddit for an hour? Congratulations, you just had an hour of Spanish immersion.</p>

            <p>I love that there's no pressure with this approach. Some days you'll notice the foreign words more than others, and that's fine. The repetition happens naturally as you encounter the same words across different websites and contexts.</p>

            <h2>The Compound Effect of Small Exposures</h2>

            <p>Here's what surprised me most about using Janus: the learning happens so gradually that you don't really notice it. Then one day you're reading something and realize you understood a whole sentence in another language without translating it in your head first.</p>

            <p>It's like how you learned to recognize your friends' cars or voices – not through deliberate study, but through repeated casual exposure. Your brain is incredible at pattern recognition when you give it enough examples.</p>

            <p>The compound effect is real. Each small exposure builds on the last one. After a few weeks, words that were foreign start feeling familiar. After a few months, you're recognizing them instantly. It's not dramatic day-to-day progress, but the cumulative effect is pretty amazing.</p>

            <h2>Give It a Try</h2>

            <p>If you've been putting off learning a language because you "don't have time," this might be exactly what you need. Install Janus from the Chrome Web Store and pick a language you're curious about. Then just... browse the internet like normal.</p>

            <p>No pressure, no schedules, no guilt if you miss a day. Just let the learning happen in the background while you live your digital life. Your future self will thank you when you suddenly understand that foreign movie without subtitles.</p>

          <article class="prose prose-invert prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-200 space-y-6">
            <p><strong>Quick version:</strong> Your brain learns words better through repeated casual encounters than intensive study sessions. Here's why that matters and how to use it.</p>
            
            <h2>The Magic Number: 5-10 Exposures</h2>
            
            <p>Ever wonder why some words stick effortlessly while others slip away no matter how hard you try to memorize them? It comes down to repetition, but not the kind you think.</p>

            <p>Research shows that most people need to encounter a new word about 5-10 times in different contexts before it really sticks. Not five times in a row during a study session – five separate encounters spread across days or weeks, each time in a slightly different situation.</p>

            <p>Think about how you learned words like "spam" (the email kind, not the meat). You probably didn't sit down and study its definition. Instead, you saw it mentioned in articles, heard friends complain about it, noticed it in your email settings. Each casual encounter reinforced the meaning until it became automatic.</p>

            <h2>Your Brain on Repetition</h2>

            <p>When you encounter a word repeatedly, your brain physically changes. Each exposure strengthens the neural pathways associated with that word, like water carving deeper grooves in rock. Scientists call this "memory consolidation," but I think of it as your brain building highways to information it uses often.</p>

            <p>The beautiful thing about this process is that it happens automatically. You don't have to consciously decide to remember something – if you see it enough times in meaningful contexts, your brain files it away in long-term storage.</p>

            <p>This is why cramming doesn't work for language learning. Sure, you might remember 100 vocabulary words long enough to pass a test, but without repeated exposure in varied contexts, most of them fade within weeks.</p>

            <h2>Context Changes Everything</h2>

            <p>Here's where it gets interesting: each time you encounter a word in a new context, you learn something additional about it. Maybe the first time you see "banco" it's in a sentence about going to the bank. The second time it's in a travel blog about sitting on a park bench (because banco means both bank and bench in Spanish).</p>

            <p>Each context adds depth to your understanding. You're not just learning definitions – you're learning how words behave in the wild. This is why people who learn languages through immersion often have more natural-sounding speech than those who learned through textbooks.</p>

            <h2>Making Repetition Happen Naturally</h2>

            <p>The trick is engineering these repeated exposures without it feeling like work. Here are some ways to do it:</p>

            <p><strong>Layer it onto existing habits.</strong> If you read news every morning, use a tool that translates some words in your articles. If you're a podcast person, try listening to the same episode twice – once with English subtitles, once with your target language.</p>

            <p><strong>Embrace the scatter-shot approach.</strong> Don't worry about learning words in any particular order. Let your interests guide you. If you're into cooking, you'll naturally encounter food vocabulary repeatedly across different recipes and food blogs.</p>

            <p><strong>Mix up the mediums.</strong> See a word in text, hear it in audio, maybe even try using it in conversation. Each mode of exposure creates different neural pathways, making the word more accessible to recall later.</p>

            <h2>Tools That Do the Heavy Lifting</h2>

            <p>You could try to create these repeated exposures manually, but honestly, who has time for that? This is where technology becomes your friend. Browser extensions like Janus automatically create those 5-10 contextual encounters by swapping words on websites you visit regularly.</p>

            <p>Language learning apps with spaced repetition (like Anki) can work too, but they require more active participation. The beauty of passive tools is that the repetition happens whether you're thinking about language learning or not.</p>

            <p>Some people create playlists of foreign songs and let them play in the background while working. Others change their phone's language settings temporarily. The key is finding systems that work with your lifestyle, not against it.</p>

            <h2>Signs It's Working</h2>

            <p>You'll know this approach is working when you start recognizing words before you consciously remember their meaning. It's that tip-of-the-tongue feeling, but in reverse – you know you know the word, even if you can't immediately access its translation.</p>

            <p>Another good sign is when you understand sentences with foreign words without mentally translating each piece. Your brain starts processing the foreign words as naturally as English ones.</p>

            <p>Don't expect dramatic daily progress. This is more like watching a plant grow – barely noticeable day-to-day, but unmistakable over weeks and months.</p>

            <h2>Common Questions</h2>

            <p><strong>Will this make me fluent?</strong> Not by itself. Repetitive exposure is fantastic for vocabulary and reading comprehension, but you'll still need active practice for speaking and writing. Think of it as building a strong foundation.</p>

            <p><strong>How long before I see results?</strong> Most people notice improved word recognition within 2-3 weeks of consistent exposure. Actual retention and recall take a bit longer – maybe 6-8 weeks for commonly encountered words.</p>

            <p><strong>Can I overdo it?</strong> Yes, if too many words on a page are foreign, comprehension breaks down and learning stops. Start with maybe 5-10% foreign words and adjust based on your comfort level.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Your brain is wired to learn through repetition and context – that's how you mastered English as a kid. The challenge with adult language learning is recreating those conditions artificially. But when you do, the results can feel almost magical.</p>

            <p>Stop fighting your brain's natural learning patterns. Instead of cramming vocabulary lists, create systems that give you repeated, varied exposures to new words. Let the compound effect do its work while you go about your normal routine.</p>

            <p>Language learning doesn't have to be a second job. Sometimes the best approach is the one that happens so naturally, you barely notice it's working.</p>
