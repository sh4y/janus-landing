    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
      <li><strong>No personal data is linked to your translation activity by default.</strong> We do not associate your identity with the words you translate or the sites you visit.</li>
      <li><strong>No browsing history or personal information is stored.</strong> Janus processes only the minimal text needed for translation and never stores your browsing history or personal details.</li>
      <li><strong>We cannot take down personal information because we do not collect any.</strong> Janus is designed so that we never see, store, or process any information that could identify you as a person. There is simply nothing for us to remove.</li>
      <li><strong>Premium analytics are strictly opt-in.</strong> If you pay for a premium subscription and explicitly opt in, we may collect limited analytics to help you track your vocabulary growth. These analytics are never linked to your real identity and are used only to improve your experience. Opting out of analytics is only relevant after you have explicitly opted in.</li>
      <li><strong>We never sell or share your data with third parties.</strong> All data is used solely to provide and improve the Janus service.</li>
      <li><strong>All data is routed and parsed exclusively through private servers hosted on Microsoft infrastructure.</strong> Our service agreements with Microsoft explicitly prevent anyone, including service providers, from viewing your data. Your privacy is protected at every step of the process.</li>
